/*
Instructions:

For this problem set you will be working with a
list of U.S. Presidents stored as an array of
objects. The array has **already been provided for
you** as a variable named "presidents".

You can see the full list of us presidents in the
provided file named `us-presidents.js`

All of the following problems require that you
use the `presidents` array to solve them.

Only use either `.map()`, `.find()` or `.filter()` to solve the problems in the problem set

  * Do not use `.forEach()`

You can use any additional variables that you deem necessary
to solve each problem.

You can use either regular functions or
arrow functions **for your iterator callbacks**
